                        <h1>Regulation</h1>
                        <p>
                            Over time, the performance of a piano action tends to decline, due to the compression of felt, warping of wood, and other types of wear.
                            A skilled technician can restore it to optimal precision, in a process called <b>regulation</b>, which involves adjustments ranging from turning a small screw to sanding down a wood surface. <br /> <br />
                            Many new pianos are not perfectly regulated when released from the factory, or quickly lose their regulation when moved to their new home.<br />
                            The goal of regulation is to make the piano's touch and sound consistent across all notes, allow it to comfortably achieve the widest possible range of dynamics, and make the keys responsive to even the most rapid or most subtle motions of the player.

                        <p>
                            Pianos have a limited lifetime, usually measured in decades. <br />
                            However, different parts have different lifetimes. Regular replacement of worn parts can therefore extend a piano's lifetime by decades. <br /><br />
                            <b>Restoration</b> implies more on replacement work, while  <b>Rebuilding</b> implies more on repair work and need more intensive work than restoration.<br />

                        <h1>Moving Piano</h1>
                        <p>
                            Moving a piano is a difficult procedure. There is risk to the piano, risk of bodily injury to the person moving the piano and other people and risk of damage to other property. Though moving a piano may seem like a simple procedure, there are hidden factors which compound the procedure. <br />
                            Pianos are difficult to move and <b>should only be moved by a professional</b> who is careful, properly trained, insured, and has the proper equipment.

                            Pianos are a fine piece of furniture, and in this role they benefit from cleaning and polishing, done carefully to avoid introduction of any fluids into the piano's interior.<br />
                            For many piano finishes, dust is better removed with a feather duster or a vacuum cleaner rather than a cloth, which minimizes the abrasive effect of the dust. <br />
                            A Piano Technician should be consulted for recommendations on cleaning and polishing products suitable for a piano.
